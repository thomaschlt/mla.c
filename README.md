# MLA (Multi-head Linear Attention) Implementation in C 🚀

A C implementation of Multi-head Linear Attention with RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) support.

## Features ✨

- Multi-head attention mechanism
- RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding) implementation
- Memory-efficient key-value caching
- Content and positional attention scoring
- Numerically stable softmax implementation

## Paper Implemented 📄

This implementation is based on the ["DeepSeek-V3 Technical Report"]((https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19437)) by DeepSeek-AI
## Next To Do 📝

- [ ] Add batch processing support
- [ ] Optimize memory usage
- [ ] Implement parallel processing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
